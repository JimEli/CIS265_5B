# Pima CC CIS265 Week #5 Project B

 Write a function that computes the value of the following polynomial:
```text
  3x^5 + 2x^4 – 5x^3 – x^2 +7x – 6
```
Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x, calls the function to compute the value of the polynomial, and then displays the value returned by the function.

Notes:
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141), using C language options.
* Conservative limits placed upon range of acceptable values of x.
* Scientific notation is accepted as input.
